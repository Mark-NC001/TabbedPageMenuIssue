# TabbedPageMenuIssue

This highlights a possible issue with the Menu that displays in Windows
if the wcreen is not wide enough to show all the tabs.

Run the app, change the width so only the tabs Page 1 to Page 4 are displayed.

Click the ellipse which will pop up a menu showing the remaining tabs.

Note that the text of the menu is white and barely readable against
whatever the colour of the menu background is!
